# Ring-Swagger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metosin/ring-swagger.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metosin/ring-swagger)

[Swagger](...) implementation for Ring using Prismatic [Schema](https://github.com/Prismatic/schema) for data modelling.

- Provides handlers for both [Resource listing](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Resource-Listing) and [Api declaration](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/API-Declaration).
- Does not solve how the routes, models and endpoints are collected from your web app (and by so should be compatible with all Ring-based libraries)
- Provides a clean Map-based interface to create Swagger Spec out of the route definitions

For embedding a [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) into your Ring-app, check out the [ring-swagger-ui](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger-ui).

## Existing Adapters
